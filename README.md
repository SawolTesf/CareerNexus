# CareerNexus: A LinkedIn Clone

Welcome to CareerNexus! This project is a full-stack web application inspired by LinkedIn, built using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN stack). I designed this project to demonstrate my expertise in full-stack development, API creation and integration, user authentication, and responsive design.

## Project Description

CareerNexus is a professional networking platform that allows users to connect with others, share posts, and explore job opportunities. Users can create a profile, showcase their skills and experience, and connect with potential employers and colleagues. The application also features dark mode for a comfortable viewing experience.

Please note: This project is purely for demonstration purposes.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in using their email.
- **User Interactions**: Users can like posts and connect with others.
- **Post Creation**: Users can create posts with text, images, clips, files, and audio.
- **Social Media Integration**: Users can attach their LinkedIn and Twitter accounts to their profile.
- **Responsive Design**: The application features a clean UI and is responsive on all devices.
- **Dark Mode**: Users can switch to dark mode for a comfortable viewing experience.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Full-Stack Development**: Built a complete web application using the MERN stack.
- **API Creation & Integration**: Created an API from scratch and made API calls to fetch data.
- **User Authentication**: Implemented user authentication using email.
- **Responsive Design**: Created a mobile-friendly layout using media queries.

## Technical Details

CareerNexus is developed using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. It employs React hooks for state management and component lifecycles. The application fetches data from a custom API to provide real-time user information. The layout and responsiveness are achieved using CSS flexbox and media queries.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to enhance the app with the following features:

- **Notifications**: Implement notifications for likes and new connections.
- **Direct Messaging**: Allow users to send direct messages to their connections.
- **Job Postings**: Allow companies to post job listings.
